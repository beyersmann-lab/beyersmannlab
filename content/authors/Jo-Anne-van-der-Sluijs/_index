Jo-Anne is interested in (psycho)linguistic applications of network science. Furthermore, she is interested in acquired language disorders and the (dys)functioning of the brain.

In 2021, Jo-Anne obtained her BA in Linguistics (cum laude) at the University of Amsterdam (the Netherlands). She continued her studies with the European Master's in Clinical Linguistics (EMCL++; University of Groningen, Ghent University, and University of Eastern Finland), from which she graduated top of her class in 2023. 

In 2024, Jo-Anne started her PhD with the International Doctorate for Experimental Approaches to Language and Brain (IDEALAB) program, under the supervision of Associate Professor Lisi Beyersmann at Macquarie University (Australia), and Assistant Professor Adri√† Rofes and Professor Roel Jonkers at the University of Groningen (the Netherlands). Her project focuses on how the interaction of semantics, phonology and morphology in the mental lexicon can be captured by word networks created from behavioural, linguistic tasks.
