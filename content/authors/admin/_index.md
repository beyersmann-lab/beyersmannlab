Lisi is interested in how the human reading system processes printed words, with a particular focus on units that carry meaning ("morphemes"). Besides her focus on rapid, automatic reading mechanisms in adults, she is also interested in how children learn to read and when during reading development word processing becomes more intuitive and automatized.

Following her PhD, she was awarded four consecutive internationally competitive research fellowships which allowed her to carry out several years of in-depth research in the field of reading and reading acquisition, and expand her collaborative network.

She spent 3.5 years (2013-2016) as a postdoctoral research fellow within the Cognitive Psychology Laboratory (LPC) at *Aix-Marseille University, France*, which was funded by the award of an internationally competitive full-time Fyssen Foundation research fellowship (2 years), followed by a prestigeous Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship from the Brain & Language Research Institute (1.5 years).

In October 2016, she moved back to Australia to take up a 3-year full-time Macquarie University Research Fellowship (MQRF).

She is currently employed as an ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) Fellow at the Department of Cognitive Science at *Macquarie University*.
