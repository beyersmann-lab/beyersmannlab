Alessia is interested in the morpho-syntactic processes occurring in language, both oral and written. She obtained her BA in Italian literature in 2019 at the University of Padua (Italy). There, she also earned her MA in Linguistics in 2021, studying the influence of syntax on attention during reading by patients affected by neglect dyslexia. 


In 2022, Alessia started her PhD journey within the International Doctorate for Experimental Approaches to Language and Brain (IDEALAB) program, investigating morphological processing in healthy speakers as well as people with acquired dyslexia. She was supervised by Associate Professor Lisi Beyersmann at Macquarie University (Australia), Assistant Professor Srdjan Popov and Professor Roel Jonkers at the University of Groningen (the Netherlands).
