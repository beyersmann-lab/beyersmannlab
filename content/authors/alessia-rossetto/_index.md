Alessia is interested in the morpho-syntactic processes occurring in language, both oral and written. She is currently studying the morphological processing of words in people affected by acquired dyslexia. 


Alessia obtained her BA in Italian literature in 2019 at the University of Padua (Italy). There, she also earned her MA in Linguistics in 2021, studying the influence of syntax on attention during reading by patients affected by neglect dyslexia. 


In 2022, Alessia started her PhD in the International Doctorate for Experimental Approaches to Language and Brain (IDEALAB) program. She is supervised by Dr. Lisi Beyersmann at Macquarie University (Australia) and by Prof. Roel Jonkers at the University of Groningen (the Netherlands).
