Alex completed his Psychology Honours thesis under the supervision of Dr Lisi Beyersmann and PhD candidate Demian Stoyanov. In his thesis, Alex used eye-tracking to investigate the rate at which emojis are integrated during reading. He contributed to an emerging field in research, as little is known about where emojis fit in with the reading process.

Alex enjoyed a challenging yet rewarding year in his first major research project.
