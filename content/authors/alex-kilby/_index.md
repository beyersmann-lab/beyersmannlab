Alex is currently completing his Psychology Honours thesis under the supervision of Dr Lisi Beyersmann and PhD candidate Demian Stoyanov. In his thesis, Alex is using eye-tracking to investigate the rate at which emojis are integrated during reading. He is excited to contribute to an emerging field in research, as little is known about where emojis fit in with the reading process.

Alex is looking forward to a challenging yet rewarding year in his first major research project.
