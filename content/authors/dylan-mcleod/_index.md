Dylan is currently completing a Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) and a Bachelor of Human Sciences (Majoring in Cognitive Science). 

He is interested in how different brain disorders can impact functioning and how these disorders are assessed and treated. Specifically, he is interested in studying and treating individuals with acquired brain disorders (e.g. aphasia). He is ultimately aiming to pursue these interests in a career as a Clinical Neuropsychologist.
