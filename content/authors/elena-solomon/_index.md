Elena is currently completing her Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) at Macquarie University. She is undertaking her Honours thesis under the supervision of Dr Lisi Beyersmann.

Her research investigates whether differences in morpheme type influence the morpheme transposition effect and whether this effect is modulated by the predictability of sentence context. Her study uses eye-tracking technology to examine the early stages of visual word recognition. Elena hopes to pursue further research and postgraduate study in psychology, driven by her passion for understanding the brain and human behaviour.
