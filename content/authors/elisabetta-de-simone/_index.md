Elisabetta is a cotutelle PhD Candidate of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (Munich, Germany) and Macquarie University (Sydney), currently pursuing a doctorate in psycholinguistics. The purpose of her research is to investigate how the orthographic features of different languages influence reading behaviour. Specifically she looks at how German, Italian, French, and English readers process letters, syllables, and morphemes. By understanding the differences and similarities in reading different orthographies, she aims to pinpoint which cognitive processes in reading behaviour are language-specific, and which ones are general. Her main goal is to build knowledge about the underlying, unimpaired, reading system in the brain, in order to contribute to developing better teaching strategies for children learning to read and compensation methods for individuals affected by acquired, and developmental, language impairments.
