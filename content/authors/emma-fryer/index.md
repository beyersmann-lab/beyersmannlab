Emma is undertaking a Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) at Macquarie University, and is currently completing her Honours Thesis under the Supervision of Dr Lisi Beyersmann. 

Her research focuses on the effects of semantics and word prediction on the cognitive processes that drive reading compound words. Her study uses eye-tracking technology to investigate these effects in the late stages of visual word recognition. Emma wishes to pursue further research and study in allied health in the future, with the hopes of helping people with cognitive and neurological disorders.
