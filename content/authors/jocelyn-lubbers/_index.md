Jocelyn is interested in both acquired and developmental language impairments. Her main aim is to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life of individuals with language impairments through research.

Jocelyn obtained her BA in European Languages and Cultures in 2020 at the University of Groningen (the Netherlands). In 2022, she completed her joint MSc degree in Clinical Linguistics (EMCL+) at the University of Groningen and the University of Eastern Finland.

In 2023, Jocelyn started her PhD in the International Doctorate for Experimental Approaches to Language and Brain (IDEALAB) program. She was supervised by Associate Professor Lisi Beyersmann at Macquarie University (Australia) and by Professor Roel Jonkers, Dr DÃ¶rte de Kok and Dr Barry de Groot at the University of Groningen (the Netherlands). Her project focused on the development of an adaptive digital assessment tool for adults with dyslexia in both Dutch and English.
