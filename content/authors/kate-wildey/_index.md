Kate is currently enrolled at Macquarie University completing her Bachelor of Psychology (Honours). She is working on completing her thesis under the supervision of Dr Lisi Beyersmann. Her research explores the effect of semantic transparency and sentence predictability on the morpheme transposition effect in compound words. Her study will utilise eye-tracking technology to look at early-stage measures of word-processing during sentence reading.


Kate's goal is to continue her studies in the field of neuropsychology and to help people with cognitive disorders.
