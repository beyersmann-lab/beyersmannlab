**Research Interests**

Silvana’s research focuses on dyslexia, writing instruction, and speech-to-text technology (STT). The aim of her ongoing project is to investigate if the speech recognition technology can be used in a beneficial way by students with dyslexia for composing texts. She is also interested in the challenges of implementing such a tool in schools, as well as the features of the pupils and the environment that facilitate or create barriers to its use. As a former speech pathologist and a primary school teacher, Silvana’s research combines her practical experience in language teaching and the treating of dyslexia with her theoretical knowledge.

Silvana is a visiting researcher at Macquarie University coming from the Zurich University of Teacher Education in Switzerland and the University of Fribourg (CH). Her research project and her research stay in Sydney are both fully funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).

**Biography and Employment**
