Given that morphological segmentation appears to be a core principle in second language processing, it raises the question of how morphological transfer is handled by the bilingual reading system. Therefore, based on these critical findings from within-language research, we ask whether or not there is any interplay between the morphemic parsing systems across languages.

This project uses a number of sophisticated cross-languages priming paradigms, including the recording of event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore cross-language influences on morphological processing in Turkish-English, Chinese-English, and French-English bilinguals.
