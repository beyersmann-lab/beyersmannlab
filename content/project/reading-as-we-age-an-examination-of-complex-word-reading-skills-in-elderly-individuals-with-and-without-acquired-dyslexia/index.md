title: "Reading as we age: An examination of complex word reading skills in
  elderly individuals with and without acquired dyslexia"
date: 2023-08-10T04:37:42.007Z
summary: The majority of English words consist of multiple morphemes
  (e.g., un-lock-able), but how elderly people read complex words is not well
  understood. This project draws on a range of innovative methods to study the
  cognitive mechanisms that underlie complex word reading, by examining older
  individuals with and without acquired dyslexia. Expected outcomes are a richer
  understanding of the mechanisms and components of the ageing reading system.
  By studying the decline and failure of complex word reading skills, this
  project has the potential to inform the effectiveness of morphological
  intervention programs, to the benefit of Australia’s ageing population.
