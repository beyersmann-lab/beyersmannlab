The use of emojis in digital communication has become increasingly popular, and a growing number of emojis are now widely available across different chat and email platforms. However, the cognitive underpinning of emoji processing, and in particular the question of how emojis are integrated into online reading processes, are not well understood.

This project uses eye-tracking and emoji priming techniques to explore the mechanisms by which readers incorporate the information conveyed by emojis in their reading.
