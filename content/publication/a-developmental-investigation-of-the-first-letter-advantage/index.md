abstract: Skilled adult readers identify the first letter in a string of random
  consonants better than letters at any other position, and this advantage for
  the initial position is not seen with strings of symbols or familiar shapes.
  Here we examined the developmental trajectory of this first-letter advantage
  by testing children in Grades 1 to 5 of primary education in a
  target-in-string identification paradigm. Strings of five letters or five
  simple shapes were briefly presented, and children were asked to identify a
  target letter/shape at one of the five possible positions. Children responded
  by choosing between the target and an alternative that was a neighboring
  letter/shape (e.g., TPFMR-M vs. F at position 4). The serial position function
  linking accuracy to position-in-string was found to be affected by reading
  ability differently for letter stimuli compared with shape stimuli, and this
  was found to be almost entirely driven by differences in performance in
  identifying targets at the first position in strings. Here, accuracy increased
  more rapidly for letter stimuli than for shape stimuli as reading ability
  increased. This developmental pattern, plus the fact that letter strings were
  composed of random consonants and the task minimized the involvement of verbal
  recoding, allows us to exclude an explanation of the first-letter advantage in
  terms of serial reading strategies or phonological decoding. The findings
  suggest that the first-letter advantage is a function of, and a marker for,
  increasingly efficient orthographic processing.
