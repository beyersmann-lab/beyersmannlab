abstract: "Recent research with adult participants using the flankers task has
  shown that the recognition of central target words is facilitated by the
  presence of morphologically related flanker words. Here we explored the
  development of such morphological flanker effects in two groups of primary
  school children (average ages = 8 years 6 months and 10 years 3 months) and a
  group of adult participants. We examined effects of a transparent
  morphological relation in two conditions: one where the target was the stem
  and flankers were derivations (e.g., *farmer farm farmer*) and the other where
  the flankers were stems and the target was the derived form (e.g., *farm
  farmer farm*). Morphological flanker effects were compared with repetition
  flanker effects with the same set of stimuli (e.g., *farm farm farm*; *farmer
  farmer farmer*), and effects of related flankers were contrasted with the
  appropriate unrelated flankers. Results revealed no significant effect of
  morphological relatedness in the two groups of children and a significant
  effect in the adult group, but only for suffixed targets and stem flankers.
  Repetition effects for stem targets were found across all groups, whereas
  repetition effects for suffixed targets were found only in the older children
  and adults. These results show that morphological processing, in a context
  involving multiple words presented simultaneously, takes several years to
  develop and that morphological complexity (stem vs. derived) is a limiting
  factor for repetition effects in the flankers task with young children."
