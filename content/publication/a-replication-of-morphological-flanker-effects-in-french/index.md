abstract: Grainger et al. examined flanker effects in an experiment where target
  words could be morphologically complex (e.g. *farmer*), have a
  pseudo-morphological structure (e.g. *corner*), or have no morphological
  structure (e.g. *cashew*). Target words were flanked on both sides by the
  left-aligned embedded word in the related flanker condition (e.g. *farm*
  *farmer* *farm*; *corn* *corner* *corn*; *cash* *cashew* *cash*). Effects of
  related flankers were compared with matched unrelated flankers (e.g. *book*
  *farmer* *book*). Significantly greater effects of flanker relatedness were
  found with morphologically related flankers compared with both
  pseudo-morphological flankers and non-morphological embedded word flankers.
  However, more recent work in Spanish has failed to replicate this specific
  pattern. We therefore sought to replicate our findings in French, while
  increasing experimental power and modifying the nonword targets. The results
  of the present study successfully replicate the findings of Grainger et al.
