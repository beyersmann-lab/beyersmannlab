abstract: The Battery for Assessment of Plural Processing in Aphasia (Frequency)
  assesses the ability of people with aphasia to produce plurals, and the
  effects of frequency on this ability. Some people with aphasia make errors in
  their  use of the plural inflection, perhaps producing a singular (e.g.
  two  horse) when a plural is appropriate or vice versa (e.g. one horses), or
  use alternative ways to indicate number (e.g. horse, two of them). This test
  battery examines whether the ability of a person with aphasia to  correctly
  process plurals varies depending on the frequency of the  target word. By
  examining plural processing across four different tasks,  it enables
  identification not only of whether processing of regular  plural inflection is
  intact or impaired, but also the level of impairment in the language system
  that is the source of this impairment.
