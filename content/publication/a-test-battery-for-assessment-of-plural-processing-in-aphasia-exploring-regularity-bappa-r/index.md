abstract: The Battery for Assessment of Plural Processing in
  Aphasia  (Regularity) assesses the ability of people with aphasia to produce
  plurals, and the effects of regularity on this ability. Some people with
  aphasia make errors in their use of the plural inflection, perhaps producing a
  singular (e.g. two horse) when a plural is appropriate or vice versa (e.g. one
  horses), or use alternative ways to indicate number  (e.g. horse, two of
  them). This test battery examines whether an  individual with aphasia's
  ability to correctly produce plurals varies  depending on the regularity of a
  plural. For instance, some speakers may find it harder to produce an irregular
  plural (e.g. feet) compared to a regular plural (e.g. kings), while others may
  show the reverse pattern.
