abstract: "The present study combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings
  with fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) to investigate automatic neural
  responses to morphemes in developing and skilled readers. Native
  English-speaking children (*N* = 17, grade 5-6) and adults (*N* = 28) were
  presented with rapid streams of base stimuli (6 Hz) interleaved periodically
  with oddballs (i.e., every fifth item, oddball stimulation frequency: 1.2 Hz).
  In a manipulation-check condition, tapping into word recognition, oddballs
  featured familiar words (e.g., *roll*) embedded in a stream of consonant
  strings (e.g., *ktlq*). In the experimental conditions, the contrast between
  oddball and base stimuli was manipulated in order to probe selective stem and
  suffix identification in morphologically structured pseudowords (e.g., stem +
  suffix pseudowords such as *softity* embedded in nonstem + suffix pseudowords
  such as *trumess*). Neural responses at the oddball frequency and harmonics
  were analyzed at the sensor level using non-parametric cluster-based
  permutation tests. As expected, results in the manipulation-check condition
  revealed a word-selective response reflected by a predominantly
  left-lateralized cluster that emerged over temporal, parietal, and occipital
  sensors in both children and adults. However, across the experimental
  conditions, results yielded a differential pattern of oddball responses in
  developing and skilled readers. Children displayed a significant response that
  emerged in a mostly central occipital cluster for the condition tracking stem
  identification in the presence of suffixes (e.g., *softity* vs. *trumess*). In
  contrast, adult participants showed a significant response that emerged in a
  cluster located in central and left occipital sensors for the condition
  tracking suffix identification in the presence of stems (e.g., *softity* vs.
  *stopust*). The present results suggest that while the morpheme identification
  system in Grade 5-6 children is not yet adult-like, it is sufficiently mature
  to automatically analyze the morphemic structure of novel letter strings.
  These findings are discussed in the context of theoretical accounts of
  morphological processing across reading development."
