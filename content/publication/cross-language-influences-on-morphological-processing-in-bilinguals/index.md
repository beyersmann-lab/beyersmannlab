abstract: Several decades of reading research in bilinguals have revealed
  evidence for cross-language influences on the visual recognition of simple
  words (e.g., *farm*). However, comparatively little is known about
  cross-language transfer mechanisms involved when reading morphologically
  complex words (e.g., *farmer* or *farmhouse*). In this chapter, we provide a
  review of studies examining the processing of affixed and compound words in
  bilinguals, with a particular focus on studies directly targeting
  cross-language transfer. The key findings support the idea that bilinguals
  rapidly and simultaneously activate the morphological features in both of
  their languages during the early, automatic stages of visual word recognition.
  Implications for theoretical models of morphological processing in bilinguals
  and future directions are discussed.
