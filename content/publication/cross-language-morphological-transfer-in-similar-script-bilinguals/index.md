abstract: The current study explored cross-language morphological transfer
  mechanisms using a similar-script morphological translation priming paradigm
  in highly proficient unbalanced Turkish (first language; L1)–English (second
  language; L2) bilinguals. Using noncognate English and Turkish stimuli that
  shared a similar meaning with no form overlap (e.g., ice [Eng.] – buz [Tur.]),
  in Experiment 1, L2 English stem targets (e.g., *ICE*) were primed by affixed
  L1 nonwords (e.g., *buzca* [*iceish*]), nonaffixed L1 nonwords (e.g., *buznak*
  [*iceald*]), and unrelated L1 nonwords (e.g., *tuşku* [*keyment*]). The
  results revealed priming effects in both the affixed and nonaffixed nonword
  conditions relative to the unrelated control, and significantly larger priming
  in the affixed than the nonaffixed condition. In addition, enhanced
  cross-language morphological transfer effects were evidenced in bilinguals
  with an earlier age of L2 acquisition. In Experiment 2, English stem targets
  (e.g., *ICE*) were primed by nonaffixed L1 nonwords including translated stems
  (e.g., *buznak* [*iceald*]), semantically related stems (e.g., *suzur*
  [*waterew*]), and unrelated L1 nonwords (e.g., *tuşzur* [*keyew*]). The
  results showed significantly larger priming effects in the translated
  condition compared with the semantic and unrelated control conditions, with no
  priming in the semantic condition relative to the unrelated condition,
  suggesting that cross-language morphological priming effects were specifically
  due to the lexico-semantic relationship between the embedded word and its
  translation equivalent.
