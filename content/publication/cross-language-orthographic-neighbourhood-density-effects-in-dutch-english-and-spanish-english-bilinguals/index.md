abstract: "Processing a word in a second language (L2) may be hindered or helped
  by the simultaneous activation of similar words present in L2 and in addition
  by similar words that occur in the first language (L1). Precise mechanisms for
  influencing variables within L2 and cross-language processing are still little
  understood. The current visual word recognition study explored orthographic
  neighborhood density (ND) effects in L2 English, replicating the effects for
  Dutch–English while expanding the exploration to a new language combination,
  Spanish–English. The within- and across-language effects were explored in a
  group of Dutch–English and Spanish–English bilinguals. English L2 targets were
  subdivided into four ND conditions: high L1 + high L2, high L1 + low L2, low
  L1 + high L2, and low L1 + low L2. For Experiment 1, an analysis of
  generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) revealed that Dutch
  (L1)–English (L2) bilinguals showed a facilitatory main effect of English ND
  on reaction times and error rates. However, an inhibitory main effect of L1
  Dutch ND on L2 visual word recognition was only observed for reaction times,
  not error rates. Overall, no interaction was detected between L1 and L2 NDs
  for reaction times or error rates. Additionally, a factorial permutation test
  confirmed the L2 facilitatory effect on both reaction times and error rates,
  while it supported an L1 inhibitory effect for error rates only. In Experiment
  2, a GLMM analysis replicated the L2 facilitatory effect on reaction times in
  Spanish (L1)–English (L2) bilinguals but did not reveal an inhibitory main
  effect of L1 on L2 word recognition. Instead, we found a significant
  interaction between English (L2) and Spanish (L1) ND. Reaction time patterns
  were confirmed by the non-parametric analysis, although with only a marginally
  significant interaction. For error rates, no effect for ND was detected using
  GLMMs. However, the permutation test revealed significant L2 facilitatory and
  L1 inhibitory effects on L2 word recognition but no significant interaction.
  Our data confirm a robust L2 facilitatory main effect of ND on reaction times
  across experiments and analyses, while L1 inhibitory main and interaction
  effects were less robust across experiments and analyses. The latter may be
  dependent on language specificity and speaker characteristics."
