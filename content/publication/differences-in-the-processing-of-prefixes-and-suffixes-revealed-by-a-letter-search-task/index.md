abstract: A letter-search task was used to test the hypothesis that affixes are
  chunked during morphological processing and that such chunking might operate
  differently for prefixes and suffixes. Participants had to detect a letter
  target that was embedded either in a prefix or suffix (e.g., ‘R’ in propoint
  or filmure) or in a non-prefix beginning or non-suffix ending (e.g., ‘R’ in
  cropoint or filmire). Prefixed and suffixed letter-strings comprised real
  stems and affixes but never formed a real word. Effects of letter cluster
  frequency were also investigated by manipulating the frequency of non-affix
  beginnings and endings. Letter search took longer in suffixes compared with
  non-suffix endings but not for prefixes compared with non-prefix beginnings.
  Moreover, performance was not affected by letter cluster frequency. We
  interpret our findings in the light of recent accounts of morpho-orthographic
  segmentation and the different function of prefixes and suffixes.
