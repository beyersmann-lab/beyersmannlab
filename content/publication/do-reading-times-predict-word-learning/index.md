abstract: Theories of learning and attention predict a positive relationship
  between reading times on unfamiliar words and their learning; however,
  empirical findings of contextual learning studies range from a strong positive
  relationship to no relationship. To test the conjecture that longer reading
  times may reflect different cognitive and metacognitive processes, the need to
  infer novel word meanings from context was deliberately manipulated. One
  hundred and two adult first– and second–language English language speakers
  read sixty passages containing pseudowords while their eye movements were
  recorded. The passages were either preceded or followed by pseudoword
  definitions. After reading, participants completed posttests of cued meaning
  recall and form recognition. Meaning recall was positively associated with (i)
  individual cumulative reading times and (ii) participants’ general vocabulary
  knowledge, but not when definitions were provided before reading. Form
  recognition was unaffected by cumulative reading times. Our findings call for
  a cautious approach in making causative links between eye–movement measures
  and vocabulary learning from reading.
