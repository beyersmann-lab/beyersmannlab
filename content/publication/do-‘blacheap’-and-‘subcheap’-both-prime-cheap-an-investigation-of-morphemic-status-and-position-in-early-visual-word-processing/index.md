abstract: "Much research suggests that words comprising more than one morpheme
  are decomposed into morphemes in the early stages of visual word recognition.
  In the present masked primed lexical decision study, we investigated whether
  or not decomposition occurs for both prefixed and suffixed nonwords and for
  nonwords which comprise a stem and a non-morphemic ending. Prime-target
  relatedness was manipulated in three ways: (1) primes shared a semantically
  transparent morphological relationship with the target (e.g., subcheap-CHEAP,
  cheapize-CHEAP); (2) primes comprised targets and non-affixal letter strings
  (e.g., blacheap-CHEAP, cheapstry-CHEAP); and (3) primes were real, complex
  words unrelated to the target (e.g., miscall-CHEAP, idealism-CHEAP). Both
  affixed and non-affixed nonwords significantly facilitated the recognition of
  their stem targets, suggesting that embedded stems are activated independently
  of whether they are accompanied by a real affix or a non-affix. There was no
  difference in priming between stems being embedded in initial and final string
  positions, indicating that embedded stem activation is position-independent.
  Finally, more priming was observed in the semantically interpretable affixed
  condition than in the non-affixed condition, which points to a semantic
  licensing mechanism during complex novel word processing."
