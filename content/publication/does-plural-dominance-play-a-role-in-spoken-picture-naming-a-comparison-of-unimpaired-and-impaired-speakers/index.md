abstract: "This study investigates the effect of frequency on plural processing.
  In particular it explores the effect of relative frequency differences between
  plurals and their singular forms on the representation of plurals. This paper
  reports data from a group of thirty-eight unimpaired speakers and compares
  their spoken picture naming of single and multiple objects to that of two
  people with acquired language impairments (aphasia). For both participant
  groups (unimpaired and impaired), we observed two key findings for picture
  naming: first, plurals that are lower in frequency than their singulars
  (singular-dominant plurals) are responded to more slowly or with more errors
  compared to their singulars. Second, for plurals that are higher in frequency
  than their singulars (plural-dominant plurals), no difference in reaction time
  or error rate was detected between singulars and plurals. By capitalising on
  patterns observed in both unimpaired and impaired language processing, this
  study suggests that plural-dominant plurals are stored differently from
  singular-dominant plurals."
