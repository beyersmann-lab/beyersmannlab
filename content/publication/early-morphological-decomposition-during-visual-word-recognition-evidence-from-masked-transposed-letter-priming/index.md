abstract: The present experiments were designed to explore the theory of early
  morpho-orthographic segmentation (Rastle, Davis, & New, Psychonomic Bulletin &
  Review 11,1090-1098, 2004), which postulates that written words with a true
  morphologically complex structure (cleaner) and those with a morphological
  pseudostructure (corner) are both decomposed into affix and stem morphemes. We
  used masked complex transposed-letter (TL) nonword primes in a lexical
  decision task. Experiment 1 replicated the well-known masked TL-priming effect
  using monomorphemic nonword primes (e.g., wran-WARN). Experiment 2 used the
  same nonword TL stems as in Experiment 1, but combined them with real suffixes
  (e.g., ish as in wranish-WARN). Priming was compared with that from
  nonsuffixed primes in which the real suffixes were replaced with nonmorphemic
  endings (e.g., el as in wranel-WARN). Significant priming was found in the
  suffixed but not in the nonsuffixed condition, suggesting that affix-stripping
  occurs at prelexical stages in visual word recognition and operates over early
  letter-position encoding mechanisms.
