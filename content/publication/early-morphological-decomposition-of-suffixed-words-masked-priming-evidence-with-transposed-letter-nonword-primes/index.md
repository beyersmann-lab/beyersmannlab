abstract: Many studies have previously reported that the recognition of a stem
  target (e.g., *teach*) is facilitated by the prior masked presentation of a
  prime consisting of a derived form of it (e.g., *teacher*). We conducted two
  lexical decision experiments to investigate masked morphological priming in
  Spanish. Experiment 1 showed that equal magnitudes of masked stem-target
  priming are obtained for both morphologically complex word primes (e.g.,
  *doloroso-DOLOR* [*painful-PAIN*]) and morphologically complex nonword primes
  that included letter transpositions within the stem (e.g.,
  *d**lo**oroso-DOLOR*). Experiment 2 used morphologically complex nonword
  primes comprising lexically illegal combinations of stems and suffixes (e.g.,
  *total* + *ito* [*a little total*]). Priming was obtained for morphologically
  related nonword primes (e.g., *totalito-TOTAL*), but not for nonword primes
  that included letter transpositions within the pseudostem (e.g.,
  *t**to**alito-TOTAL*). Our data suggest that morphoorthographic parsing
  mechanisms benefit from semantic constraints at early stages in the reading
  system, which we discuss in the context of current morphological processing
  accounts.
