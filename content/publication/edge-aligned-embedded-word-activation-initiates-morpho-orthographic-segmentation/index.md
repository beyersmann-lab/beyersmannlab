abstract: "Current evidence suggests that morphologically complex words (e.g.,
  *farmer *) are automatically segmented into their constituent morphemes
  (*farm* +  *er *) during reading, a process referred to as
  “morpho-orthographic segmentation.” Intriguingly, the evidence also suggests
  that this segmentation process even operates on words with a
  pseudo-morphological structure (e.g.,  *corner *:  *corn * +  *er *). Here we
  describe an account of morpho-orthographic segmentation for derivational
  morphology in non-agglutinative Latinate languages that underlines the key
  role played by edge-aligned embedded word activation. According to this
  account, affixes play a secondary role in the segmentation process, helping
  segmentation during the early processing of complex words only when embedded
  word activation is hindered. This provides a mechanism for initiating
  morpho-orthographic segmentation without appealing to specialized
  morphological representations. Use of edge-aligned embedded word activation is
  also thought to be the starting point of morpho-orthographic processing during
  reading development, such that efficient processing of embedded stems
  developmentally precedes processing of affixes as orthographic entities.
  Furthermore, it is the hypothesized delayed learning of orthographic
  representations for bound morphemes (morphemes that are not free-standing
  words), such as affixes, that accounts for the developmental trajectory of
  morpho-orthographic priming effects and the overall influence of morphological
  structure on processing morphologically complex stimuli. Our account of
  morpho-orthographic segmentation explains both the standard pattern of masked
  priming effects found with truly complex (e.g.,  *farmer *) and pseudo-complex
  (e.g.,  *corner *) words, as well as the pattern of priming effects obtained
  with complex nonword primes (e.g.,  *farmage*,  *cornity *)."
