abstract: Morpheme-based training programs to improve literacy skills are widely
  used with older children in the morphologically complex German language. This
  study investigated whether (1) morphological training is effective early in
  development (Grade 2) and (2) effects can be attributed to advanced
  morphological processing. Fifty-two German-speaking second-graders received an
  eight-week morpheme-based training, while an age-matched control group (*n* =
  41) attended regular language classes. We observed training effects for
  spelling and reading morphologically complex words, whereas performance on
  standardized reading tests and a morphological awareness task improved
  similarly across groups. In a masked priming task assessing implicit word
  segmentation, response times for lexical decisions decreased more strongly in
  the intervention than the control group, but there was no clear training
  impact on the pattern of morphological priming. Thus, while written language
  processing improved, it is unclear whether these effects can be attributed to
  morphological processing or unspecific gains in orthographic knowledge.
