abstract: "Two masked priming experiments investigated the impact of prime
  lexicality (word vs. nonword) and the pseudo-morphological structure of prime
  stimuli (pseudosuffixed vs. nonsuffixed) on embedded word priming effects. In
  the related prime conditions, target words were embedded at the beginning of
  prime stimuli and were followed either by a derivational suffix (e.g.,
  *corner-corn*; *cornry-corn*) or a nonsuffix but orthographically legal word
  ending (e.g., *dragon-drag*; *dragip-drag*). Lexical decisions to target words
  were facilitated by related pseudosuffixed primes compared with unrelated
  primes, and this occurred to the same extent for word primes (corner-corn) and
  nonword primes (*cornry-corn*). On the other hand, target word recognition was
  inhibited by related nonsuffixed word primes (dragon-drag), and no priming was
  found with nonsuffixed nonword primes (*dragip-drag*). Conditional suffix
  probability—the probability that a string-initial embedded word will be
  followed by a derivational suffix in a lexicon of all uninflected
  morphologically simple and derived words - determined the size of priming
  effects obtained with nonsuffixed primes. Two main conclusions are drawn on
  the basis of these findings: (a) the presence of a pseudo-morphological
  structure in words such as *corner* limits the impact of lateral inhibitory
  influences on embedded word priming, and (b) in the absence of a
  pseudo-morphological structure, one possible factor determining embedded word
  priming is the likelihood that the embedded word will be followed by a
  derivational suffix."
