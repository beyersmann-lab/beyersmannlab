abstract: Prior evidence from masked morphological priming has revealed
  conflicting findings regarding the acquisition of morpho-orthographic
  segmentation mechanisms in developing readers. Here, we examined changes in
  masked morphological priming across grade within a large sample of French
  primary school children (*n* = 191, Grades 2–5) and how these effects are
  modulated by individual differences in reading proficiency, spelling
  proficiency, and morphological awareness. Target words were preceded by either
  (a) a suffixed word prime (e.g., *tristesse–TRISTE*), (b) a suffixed nonword
  prime (e.g., *tristerie–TRISTE*), (c) a non-suffixed nonword prime (e.g.,
  *tristald–TRISTE*), or (d) an unrelated prime (e.g., *direction–TRISTE*) using
  very short prime durations (50ms). Moreover, a frequency manipulation was
  included for suffixes and non-suffixes. The results revealed robust suffixed
  word priming across all children independent of grade and proficiency. On the
  other hand, priming in the suffixed and non-suffixed nonword conditions was
  modulated by reading proficiency, with high-proficiency children showing
  facilitation and low-proficiency children showing inhibition. The effects of
  suffix and non-suffix frequency were modulated by grade, with decreasing
  effects as grade increased. None of the observed priming effects were
  modulated by grade, spelling proficiency, or morphological awareness. The
  results suggest that reading proficiency is an important predictor for
  embedded stem activation mechanisms in primary school children, which we
  discuss in the context of recent theories of morphological processing.
