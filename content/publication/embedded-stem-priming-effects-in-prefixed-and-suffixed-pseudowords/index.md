abstract: Previous research has repeatedly revealed evidence for
  morpho-orthographic priming effects in suffixed words. However, evidence for
  the morphological chunking of prefixed words is sparse and ambiguous. The goal
  of the present study was to directly contrast the processing of prefixed and
  suffixed pseudowords within the same experiment. We carried out a masked
  primed lexical decision experiment, in which the same target (*AMOUR* [LOVE])
  was preceded by a prefixed (*préamour* [prelove]), a nonprefixed (*brosamour*
  [broslove]), a suffixed (*amouresse* [lovedom]), and a nonsuffixed
  (*amourugne* [lovedel]) prime. The results revealed significant priming across
  all four conditions. Moreover, priming was modulated by individual differences
  in reading proficiency. High-proficiency readers showed evidence for embedded
  stem priming effects, independent of whether stems occurred in combination
  with a real affix or a nonaffix. This finding is of relevance to recent
  morphological processing theories, suggesting that embedded stems represent
  salient activation units during the reading of complex pseudowords.
