abstract: The aim of the current research was to test the hypothesis that the
  activation of embedded words (e.g., the *farm* in *farmhouse*) is the starting
  point for the development of an abstract morphological parsing system in
  children’s reading. To test this hypothesis, we examined the developmental
  trajectory of compound priming effects in third- and fifth-grade primary
  school children, high school students, and adults. Both children and adults
  participated in a masked priming lexical decision study comparing transparent
  compound (*farmhouse*–*farm*), opaque compound (*butterfly*–*butter*), and
  noncompound (*sandwich*–*sand*) word priming effects measured relative to an
  unrelated control. The results showed significant and equal priming effects in
  the two compound conditions but not in the noncompound priming condition. This
  robust pattern was clearly and unequivocally observed across all groups of
  participants. Our data suggest that even the youngest readers have already
  acquired the ability to rapidly and automatically identify embedded stems and
  are sensitive to the overall structure of compound words (full decomposition).
  We conclude that the activation of embedded stems provides a critical starting
  point in children’s use of morphological information when learning to read.
