abstract: Recent evidence points to the important role of embedded word
  activations in visual word recognition. The present study asked how the
  reading system prioritises word identification when not just one, but two
  different words are embedded within the same position. This question was
  addressed by using a masked primed lexical decision task (Experiment 1) with
  target words embedded in nonword primes (*tea* or *team* in *teamaction*).
  Results revealed priming independently of the length, position, or
  morphological status of the embedded word. However, when primes were used as
  targets within a word naming task (Experiment 2), participants were more
  likely to name the longer than the shorter embedded word, independent of
  morphological status. Our results suggest that the reading system gives
  priority to longer embedded words, which we discuss in the context of recent
  theories of visual word recognition.
