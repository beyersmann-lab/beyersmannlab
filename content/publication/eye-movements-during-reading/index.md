abstract: "Written words are everywhere. Learning to read is one of the main
  tasks of our early school years, and the ability to read opens up a world of
  possibilitiesâ€”we can absorb ourselves in stories, remind ourselves of
  important information, and learn new things. But few of us think about what we
  are actually doing as we read. Moving the eyes is essential for reading. For
  instance, to read this sentence, you probably began by looking at the first
  word before moving your eyes to each word in turn. All the while, you are
  working hard to recognise and understand each word. In this article, you will
  learn about why eye movements are a necessary part of reading, how they are
  measured, what they tell scientists about what is happening in the mind during
  reading, and how they change as children grow into adults.   "
