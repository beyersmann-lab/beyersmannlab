abstract: "Purpose: Spreading out study opportunities over time improves the
  retention of verbal material compared to consecutive study, yet little is
  known about the influence of temporal spacing on orthographic learning
  specifically. The current study addressed four questions: (1) do readers’ eye
  movements during orthographic learning differ under spaced and massed
  conditions?; (2) is the spacing effect observed in off-line post-tests?; (3)
  can readers’ eye movements during learning be linked with learning success in
  off-line post-tests?; (4) can E-Z Reader (Veldre et al., 2023) simulate the
  spacing effect during orthographic learning? Method: Eighty adults silently
  read sentences containing novel words while their eye movements were
  monitored. Sentences were read four times; half of the items were spaced while
  half were massed. Participants completed a post-test assessing their written
  word form learning (orthographic choice or spelling). Simulations with E-Z
  Reader were used to interpret the human data. Results: During orthographic
  learning, massed items had shorter total reading times than spaced items. A
  spacing advantage was noted in the offline post-tests. Longer fixations during
  learning were associated with higher response accuracy at post-test.
  Implementing a processing deadline enabled E-Z Reader to simulate
  participants’ eye movements; simulations suggested that massed items may have
  received less attentional processing than spaced items during learning.
  Conclusions: Temporal spacing results in longer fixations during learning and
  better learning outcomes using off-line tests. The combination of human eye
  movements and computational modelling provides useful insights into how
  reading and memory intersect and point to new directions for future research."
