abstract: "How plural forms are represented has been hotly debated for decades.
  Is it the case that regular plurals are stored as a full word form
  representation separate to their singulars (e.g., cat vs cats), or are plurals
  stored as a stem with a separate plural marker <s> (e.g., cat vs cat-<s>)? We
  will use evidence from errors in aphasic word form retrieval to explore if
  plurals are stored decomposed. "
