abstract: One key finding in support of the hypothesis that written words are
  automatically parsed into component morphemes independently of the true
  morphological structure of the stimuli, so-called morpho-orthographic
  segmentation, is that suffixed nonword primes facilitate the visual
  recognition of a stem target (rapidifier-RAPIDE) whereas non-suffixed primes
  (rapiduit-RAPIDE) do not. However, Morris, Porter, Grainger, and Holcomb
  (Language & Cognitive Processes, 26(4-6), 558-599, 2011) reported equivalent
  priming from suffixed and non-suffixed nonword primes, hence questioning the
  morphological nature of prior findings. Here we provide a further
  investigation of masked priming with morphologically complex nonword primes
  with an aim to isolate factors that modulate the size of these priming
  effects. We conducted a masked primed lexical decision experiment in French,
  in which the same target (TRISTE) was preceded by a suffixed word (tristesse),
  a suffixed nonword (tristerie), a non-suffixed nonword (tristald), or an
  unrelated prime word (direction). Participants were split into two groups,
  based on their language proficiency. The results show that in the high
  proficiency group, comparable magnitudes of priming were obtained in all three
  related prime conditions (including the non-suffixed condition) relative to
  unrelated primes, whereas in the low proficiency group, priming was
  significantly reduced in the non-suffixed condition compared to the two
  suffixed conditions. These findings provide further evidence that individual
  differences in language proficiency can modulate the impact of morphological
  factors during reading, and an explanation for the discrepant findings in
  prior research.
