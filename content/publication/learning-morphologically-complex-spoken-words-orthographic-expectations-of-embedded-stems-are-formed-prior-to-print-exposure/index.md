abstract: It is well known that information from spoken language is integrated
  into reading processes, but the nature of these links and how they are
  acquired is less well understood. Recent evidence has suggested that
  predictions about the written form of newly learned spoken words are already
  generated prior to print exposure. We extend this work to morphologically
  complex words and ask whether the information that is available in spoken
  words goes beyond the mappings between phonology and orthography. Adults were
  taught the oral form of a set of novel morphologically complex words (e.g.,
  "neshing", "neshed", "neshes"), with a 2nd set serving as untrained items.
  Following oral training, participants saw the printed form of the novel word
  stems for the first time (e.g., *nesh*), embedded in sentences, and their eye
  movements were monitored. Half of the stems were allocated a predictable and
  half an unpredictable spelling. Reading times were shorter for orally trained
  than untrained stems and for stems with predictable rather than unpredictable
  spellings. Crucially, there was an interaction between spelling predictability
  and training. This suggests that orthographic expectations of embedded stems
  are formed during spoken word learning. Reading aloud and spelling tests
  complemented the eye movement data, and findings are discussed in the context
  of theories of reading acquisition.
