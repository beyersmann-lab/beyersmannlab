abstract: Recent evidence has revealed conflicting results regarding the
  influence of letter transpositions during the recognition of morphologically
  complex words. While some studies suggest that the disruption of the morpheme
  boundary through across-boundary transpositions (e.g., *dar**nk**ess*) leads
  to the absence of masked transposed-letter (TL) priming, other studies have
  found that TL priming occurs independently of whether or not letters have been
  transposed across the boundary. We conducted three experiments to test whether
  the difference between TL- within and TL-across priming is modulated by (a)
  the transposition of internal versus external letters of the stem (Experiment
  1), (b) the overall proportion of affixed trials (Experiment 2), or (c) the
  relative frequency between prime and target (Experiment 3). The results
  revealed equal TL-within and TL-across boundary priming across all three
  experiments, which adds to previous findings suggesting that across-boundary
  transpositions do not interfere with the recognition of morphologically
  complex words.
