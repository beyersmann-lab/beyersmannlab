abstract: In this study, we looked at masked morphological priming effects in
  German children and adults beyond mean response times by taking into account
  response time distributions. We conducted an experiment comparing suffixed
  word primes (*kleidchen-KLEID*), suffixed nonword primes (*kleidtum-KLEID*),
  nonsuffixed nonword primes (*kleidekt-KLEID*), and unrelated controls
  (*träumerei-KLEID*). The pattern of priming in adults showed facilitation from
  suffixed words, suffixed nonwords, and nonsuffixed nonwords relative to
  unrelated controls, and from both suffixed conditions relative to nonsuffixed
  nonwords, thus providing evidence for morpho-orthographic and embedded stem
  priming. Children also showed facilitation from real suffixed words, suffixed
  nonwords, and nonsuffixed nonwords compared to unrelated words, but no
  difference between the suffixed and nonsuffixed conditions, thus suggesting
  that German elementary school children do not make use of morpho-orthographic
  segmentation. Interestingly, for all priming effects, a shift of the response
  time distribution was observed. Consequences for theories of morphological
  processing are discussed.
