abstract: Masked priming studies have repeatedly provided evidence for a
  form-based morpho-orthographic segmentation mechanism that blindly decomposes
  any word with the mere appearance of morphological complexity (e.g., *corn* +
  *er*). This account has been called into question by Baayen et al.
  *Psychological Review*, *118*, 438–482 (2011), who pointed out that the prime
  words previously tested in the morpho-orthographic condition vary in the
  extent to which the suffix conveys regular meaning. In the present study, we
  investigated whether evidence for morpho-orthographic segmentation can be
  obtained with a set of tightly controlled prime words that are entirely
  semantically opaque. Using a visual lexical decision task, we compared priming
  from truly suffixed primes (*hunter-HUNT*), completely opaque pseudo-suffixed
  primes (*corner-CORN*), and non-suffixed primes (*cashew-CASH*). The results
  show comparable magnitudes of priming for the truly suffixed and
  pseudo-suffixed primes, and no priming from non-suffixed primes, and therefore
  provide further important evidence in support of morpho-orthographic
  segmentation processes operating in the absence of any possible role for
  semantics.
