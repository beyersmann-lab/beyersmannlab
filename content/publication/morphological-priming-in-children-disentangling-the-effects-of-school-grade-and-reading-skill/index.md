abstract: "Masked priming studies have shown that readers decompose
  morphologically complex words (*read+er*). Interindividual differences have
  been suggested to affect this phenomenon. However, its development is poorly
  understood. We addressed this issue by taking a longitudinal approach that
  allows greater rigor in establishing the relationship between grade, reading
  skill, and morphological priming. A masked priming lexical decision task with
  suffixed words (*kleidchen-KLEID*), suffixed nonwords (*kleidtum-KLEID*),
  non-suffixed nonwords (*kleidekt-KLEID*) and unrelated primes
  (*träumerei-KLEID*) was administered to 98 children in grade 2, and again in
  grade 3 and 4 of elementary school. Reading skill was measured at each testing
  point. Grade and reading skill were associated with distinct patterns of
  priming: all priming effects increased with reading skill, whereas priming
  from non-suffixed nonwords decreased with grade. This suggests that the
  ability to identify stems can be associated with reading skills, while
  sensitivity to affixes is acquired over grades."
