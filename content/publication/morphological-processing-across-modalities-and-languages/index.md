abstract: The present study examined cross-linguistic differences in
  morphological processing in the visual and auditory modality. French and
  German adults performed a visual and auditory lexical decision task that
  involved the same translation-equivalent items. The focus of the study was on
  nonwords, which were constructed in a way that made it possible to
  independently investigate the role of stems and suffixes in the visual and
  auditory domain. Results revealed a stem-by-modality and a suffix-by-modality
  interaction, indicating that morphology plays a more prominent role in the
  visual than in the auditory domain. Moreover, a significant language-by-stem
  interaction indicated more robust morphological processing in German than in
  French. The latter result supports the idea that morphological processing is
  influenced by the morphological productivity of a language.
