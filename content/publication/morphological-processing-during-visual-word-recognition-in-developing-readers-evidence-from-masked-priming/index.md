abstract: Masked priming studies with adult readers have provided evidence for a
  form-based morpho-orthographic segmentation mechanism that "blindly"
  decomposes any word with the appearance of morphological complexity. The
  present studies investigated whether evidence for structural morphological
  decomposition can be obtained with developing readers. We used a masked primed
  lexical decision design first adopted by Rastle, Davis, and New (2004),
  comparing truly suffixed (golden-GOLD) and pseudosuffixed (mother-MOTH)
  prime-target pairs with nonsuffixed controls (spinach-SPIN). Experiment 1
  tested adult readers, showing that priming from both pseudo- and truly
  suffixed primes could be obtained using our own set of high-frequency word
  materials. Experiment 2 assessed a group of Year 3 and Year 5 children, but
  priming only occurred when prime and target shared a true morphological
  relationship, and not when the relationship was pseudomorphological. This
  pattern of results indicates that morpho-orthographic decomposition mechanisms
  do not become automatized until a relatively late stage in reading
  development.
