abstract: Does the processing of words with a transparent morphological
  structure benefit from this structure? Here we show that the flankers task
  provides an interesting novel angle on this well-researched issue.
  Participants saw transparent suffixed target words flanked by their stem (e.g.
  *farm farmer farm*), as well as pseudo-suffixed words and non-suffixed words
  flanked by their embedded word (e.g. *corn corner corn*; *cash cashew cash*).
  Targets were also tested with unrelated word flankers (e.g. *book farmer
  book*), and participants made lexical decisions to the central targets. We
  predicted that truly suffixed word identification would be facilitated by the
  presence of stem flankers over and above any purely orthographic effects that
  were expected to be revealed in the pseudo-morphological and non-morphological
  conditions. We found exactly that pattern and conclude that parallel
  processing of distinct word identities in the flankers task is modulated by
  the transparent morphological relations between these words.
