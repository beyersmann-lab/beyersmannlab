abstract: "The time-course of morphological processing during spoken word
  recognition was investigated using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in an
  auditory lexical decision task. We compared three different types of French
  words: truly suffixed (e.g., *pochette* ‘little pocket’ = *poche* ‘pocket’ +
  diminutive suffix -*ette*), pseudo-suffixed (e.g., *mouette* ‘seagull’ = *mou*
  ‘soft’ + pseudo-suffix -*ette*) and non-suffixed target words (e.g., *fortune*
  ‘fortune’ = *fort* ‘strong’ + non-suffix -*une*). Suffixed (e.g., *mouesse* =
  *mou* + suffix -*esse*) and non-suffixed nonwords (e.g., *mouipe* = *mou* +
  non-suffix -*ipe*) were also tested. The behavioural results showed that
  participants responded more slowly to non-suffixed words than to truly
  suffixed and pseudo-suffixed words, but there was no difference between the
  two suffixed conditions. Moreover, participants made more errors rejecting
  pseudo-suffixed nonwords than non-suffixed nonwords. In the ERP analyses, T0
  was shifted to the end of the embedded stem or pseudo-stem. The ERP results
  revealed enhanced N400 amplitudes for non-suffixed words compared to truly
  suffixed and pseudo-suffixed words. Again, there was no difference between the
  truly and pseudo-suffixed conditions. In addition, we found an increased N400
  amplitude for both pseudo-suffixed and non-suffixed nonwords than for words.
  The latency of the onset of this N400 effect varied between the three
  experimental conditions: the word-nonword difference occurred earliest in the
  truly suffixed condition, slightly later in the pseudo-suffixed condition and
  latest in the non-suffixed condition. Both behavioural and EEG data jointly
  suggest that spoken words with a genuine morphological structure and words
  with a pseudo-morphological structure are decomposed into morphemic sub-units.
  Moreover, the earlier appearance of the N400 effects in the truly suffixed
  condition indicates that morphological information is more readily available
  in words with a semantically transparent morphological structure."
