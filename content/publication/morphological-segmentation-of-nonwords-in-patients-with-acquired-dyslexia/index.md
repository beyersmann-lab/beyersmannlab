abstract: "The current study investigated the influence of morphological
  structure in nonword reading in a case series of individuals with acquired
  dyslexia following brain damage. The aim of the study was to test the separate
  influence of embedded stems and suffixes on reading skills by comparing four
  different types of complex nonwords: stem + suffix (e.g., *nightness*), stem +
  non-suffix (e.g., *nightlude*), non-stem + suffix (e.g., *nishtness*), and
  non-stem + non-suffix (e.g., *nishtlude*); and two types of words: suffixed
  (e.g., *baker*) and non-suffixed (e.g., *diamond*). We report five individuals
  with excellent word reading skills, including no difficulties in reading
  morphologically complex words, but who had difficulty in reading nonwords.
  Nonword reading skills drastically improved when the nonwords were composed of
  a real stem compared to a non-stem, or a real suffix compared to a non-suffix.
  In one of the individuals (RF), a significant stem-by-suffix interaction was
  observed, suggesting that they additionally benefited when letter-strings were
  decomposable into two morphemes. Another individual’s reading (SH) was
  facilitated by the presence of suffixes, but not by the presence stems. The
  impact of morphological structure on nonword reading, clearly observed in all
  five individuals, points to a pre-lexical activation of morphemes during
  reading. The results suggest that complex word reading involves three
  dissociable mechanisms: whole word processing, phonological decoding, and
  pre-lexical morpheme activation."
