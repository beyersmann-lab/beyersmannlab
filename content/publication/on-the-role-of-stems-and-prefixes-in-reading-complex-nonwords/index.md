abstract: The role of stems and prefixes in complex nonword reading was investigated in unimpaired readers and five individuals with acquired dyslexia. All participants completed a reading aloud task (and the reading impaired individuals also completed a repetition task) with four different types of nonwords: prefix + stem (refront), non-prefix + stem (tefront), prefix + non-stem (refrint), non-prefix + non-stem (tefrint); and prefixed and non-prefixed filler words. The unimpaired readers responded fastest to nonwords containing two morphemes (prefix + stem), slower to nonwords with one morpheme (non-prefix + stem; prefix + non-stem), and slowest in the non-morphemic control condition (non-prefix + non-stem), providing evidence for the added benefit of prefixes and stems during reading. The five reading impaired individuals showed facilitatory morpheme effects across both tasks, but stem-effects were more robust than affix-effects. There was no difference between the prefixed and non-prefixed words in any of the data. The impact of morphological structure on nonword reading and repetition points to the important role of morphemes across different modalities.
