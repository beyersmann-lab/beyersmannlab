  In this theoretical review, evidence for the link between spoken and written
  word knowledge is summarised, highlighting the specific hypotheses posed in
  this field and the extent to which they are informative regarding causation. A
  brief overview of major theories of orthographic learning draws attention to
  how each characterises the role of oral vocabulary within the learning
  process, and the timing of its influence. The theoretical foundations and
  evidence for two cognitive mechanisms that seek to explain the relationship
  between spoken and written word knowledge are outlined, drawing attention to a
  key difference between them: the proposed timing of the effect. *Set for
  variability* (or *mispronunciation correction*) is thought to operate from the
  point of visual exposure, while *orthographic skeletons* are thought to exert
  an influence on written word learning that begins before exposure to written
  words. The review closes with a discussion of directions for future research.
