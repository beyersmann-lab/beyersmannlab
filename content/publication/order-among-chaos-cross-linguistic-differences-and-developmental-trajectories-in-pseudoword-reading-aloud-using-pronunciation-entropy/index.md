abstract: "In this work we propose the use of Entropy to measure variability in
  pronunciations in pseudowords reading aloud: pseudowords where participants
  give many different pronunciations receive higher Entropy values. Monolingual
  adults, monolingual children, and bilingual children proficient in different
  European languages varying in orthographic depth were tested. We predicted
  that Entropy values will increase with increasing orthographic depth.
  Moreover, higher Entropy was expected for younger than older children, as
  reading experience improves the knowledge of grapheme-phoneme correspondences
  (GPCs). We also tested if interference from a second language would lead to
  higher Entropy. Results show that orthographic depth affects Entropy, but only
  when the items are not strictly matched across languages. We also found that
  Entropy decreases across age, suggesting that GPC knowledge becomes refined
  throughout grades 2-4. We found no differences between bilingual and
  monolingual children. Our results indicate that item characteristics play a
  fundamental role in pseudoword pronunciation variability, that reading
  experience is associated with reduced variability in responses, and that in
  bilingualsâ€™ knowledge of a second orthography does not seem to interfere with
  pseudoword reading aloud."
