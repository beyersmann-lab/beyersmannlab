abstract: The present study investigated whether morphological processing in
  reading is influenced by the orthographic consistency of a language or its
  morphological complexity. Developing readers in Grade 3 and skilled adult
  readers participated in a reading aloud task in four alphabetic orthographies
  (English, French, German, Italian), which differ in terms of both orthographic
  consistency and morphological complexity. English is the least consistent, in
  terms of its spelling-to-sound relationships, as well as the most
  morphologically sparse, compared to the other three. Two opposing hypotheses
  were formulated. If orthographic consistency modulated the use of morphology
  in reading, readers of English should show more robust morphological
  processing than readers of the other three languages, because morphological
  units increase the reliability of spelling-to-sound mappings in the English
  language. In contrast, if the use of morphology in reading depended on the
  morphological complexity of a language, readers of French, German, and Italian
  should process morphological units in printed letter strings more efficiently
  than readers of English. Both developing and skilled readers of English showed
  greater morphological processing than readers of the other three languages.
  These results support the idea that the orthographic consistency of a
  language, rather than its morphological complexity, influences the extent to
  which morphology is used during reading. We explain our findings within the
  remit of extant theories of reading acquisition and outline their theoretical
  and educational implications.
