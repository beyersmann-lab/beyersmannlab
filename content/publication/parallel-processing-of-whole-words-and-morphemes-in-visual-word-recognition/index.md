abstract: Models of morphological processing make different predictions about
  whether morphologically complex written words are initially decomposed and
  recognized on the basis of their morphemic subunits or whether they can
  directly be accessed as whole words and at what point semantics begin to
  influence morphological processing. In this study, we used unprimed and masked
  primed lexical decision to compare truly suffixed (darkest) and pseudosuffixed
  words (glossary) with within-boundary (drakest/golssary) to across-boundary
  (darekst/glosasry) letter transpositions. Significant transposed-letter
  similarity effects were found independently of the morphological position of
  the letter transposition, demonstrating that, in English, morphologically
  complex whole-word representations can be directly accessed at initial word
  processing stages. In a third masked primed lexical decision experiment, the
  same materials were used in the context of stem target priming, and it was
  found that truly suffixed primes facilitate the recognition of their
  stem-target (darkest-DARK) to the same extent as pseudosuffixed primes
  (glossary-GLOSS), which is consistent with theories of early
  morpho-orthographic decomposition. Taken together, our findings provide
  evidence for both whole-word access and morphological decomposition at initial
  stages of visual word recognition and are discussed in the context of a hybrid
  account.
