abstract: "We examined the reliance on phonological decoding and
  morpho-orthographic decomposition strategies in developing and skilled readers
  of French. A lexical decision experiment was conducted where the critical
  stimuli were four types of nonwords, all derived from the same base word, such
  as the French word *visage* (face) in the following examples: (a)
  pseudo-homophone (PsH) nonwords (e.g., *visaje*), (b) orthographic controls
  for PsH nonwords (e.g., *visape*), (c) pseudo-morphemic (PsM) nonwords (e.g.,
  *visageable*), and (d) orthographic controls for PsM nonwords (e.g.,
  *visagealle*, where alle is not a suffix in French). Responses to PsH and PsM
  nonwords and their controls were studied in three groups of school children
  (Grades 1, 2, and 5) and one group of skilled adult readers. PsH interference
  effects (i.e., more errors to PsH nonwords than to the corresponding controls)
  decreased during reading acquisition to become nonsignificant in skilled
  readers. Interestingly, the opposite pattern was seen in PsM interference
  effects (also measured in terms of accuracy), which were already significant
  in Grade 1 and increased during reading development to reach their maximum in
  skilled readers. These results point toward opposing learning trajectories in
  the use of phonological and morphological information when learning to
  silently read for meaning."
