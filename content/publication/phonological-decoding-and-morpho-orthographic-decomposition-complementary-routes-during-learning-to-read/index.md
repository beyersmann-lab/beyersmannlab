  We examined the reliance on phonological decoding and morpho-orthographic

  decomposition strategies in developing and skilled readers of French. A lexical decision

  experiment was conducted where the critical stimuli were four types of nonword all derived

  from the same base-word, such as the French word *visage* (face) in the following examples: 1)

  pseudo-homophones (PsH; e.g., *visaje*); 2) orthographic controls for PsH nonwords (e.g.,

  *visape*); 3) pseudo-morphemic nonwords (PsM; e.g., *visageable*); and 4) orthographic controls

  for PsM nonwords (e.g., *visagealle*, where *alle* is not a suffix in French). Responses to PsH

  and PsM nonwords and their controls were studied in 3 groups of school children (grades 1, 2,

  and 5) and one group of skilled adult readers. PsH interference effects (i.e., more errors to PsH

  nonwords than to the corresponding controls) decreased during reading acquisition to become

  non-significant in skilled readers. Interestingly, the opposite pattern was seen in PsM

  interference effects (measured also in terms of accuracy), which were already significant in

  Grade 1 and increased during reading development to reach their maximum in skilled readers.

  These results point toward opposing learning trajectories in the use of phonological and

  morphological information when learning to silently read for meaning.
