abstract: In two experiments, we examined the functional locus of *plural
  dominance* in the French spoken word production system, where singulars and
  plurals share the same phonological word form. The materials included
  singular-dominant (singular more frequent than plural) and plural-dominant
  nouns (plural more frequent than singular). In Experiment 1, participants were
  instructed to produce determiner-noun phrases in response to singular and
  plural depictions of objects. In contrast to the dominance-by-number
  interaction that is typically observed in English, Dutch and German, the
  French picture-naming data revealed a main effect of number, but no effect of
  plural dominance. When participants were instructed to produce determiner-noun
  phrases in a reading aloud task (Experiment 2), where number is
  orthographically marked, a number-by-dominance interaction emerged. Our data
  suggest that plural dominance is encoded at the word form level within the
  context of recent theories of spoken word production.
