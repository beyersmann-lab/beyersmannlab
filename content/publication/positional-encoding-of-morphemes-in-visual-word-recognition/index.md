abstract: Reading morphologically complex words requires analysis of their
  morphemic subunits (e.g., play + er); however, the positional constraints of
  morphemic processing are still little understood. The current study involved
  three unprimed lexical decision experiments to directly compare the positional
  encoding of stems and affixes during reading and to investigate the role of
  semantics during the position encoding of morphemes. Experiment 1 revealed
  that transposed compound words were harder to reject than their controls
  (e.g., dreamday vs. shadeday), whereas there was no difference between
  transposed suffixed words and their controls (e.g., fulpain vs. adepain).
  Experiment 2 replicated the results for transposed compound words of the first
  experiment and further showed that there was no difference between transposed
  prefixed words and their controls (e.g., qualifydis vs. qualifymis).
  Experiment 3 investigated the role of semantic transparency in morpheme
  transposition effects and revealed a larger morpheme transposition effect for
  semantically transparent transposed compound words (e.g., cuptea vs. taptea)
  than for semantically opaque transposed compound words (e.g., linedead vs.
  deskdead). These results bring to light important differences in the
  positional encoding of stems and affixes, suggesting that prefixes and
  suffixes are recognized in a position-dependent manner compared to the
  position-independent encoding of embedded stems and that morpheme
  transposition effects are guided by semantics. The current findings call for
  more clearly specified theoretical models of visual word recognition that
  reflect the distinct positional constraints of stems and affixes, as well as
  the influence of semantics on morphological processing.
