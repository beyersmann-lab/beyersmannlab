abstract: "This paper investigates the production of German plural nouns by two
  aphasic participants with non-fluent speech production. Experimental tasks
  included two production tasks: (1) picture naming of single and multiple
  objects, and (2) an elicitation task of singular and plural nouns. Materials
  were controlled for regularity and predictability of plural form, and for
  dominance of number, referring to the relative difference in word form
  frequency between a singular and its corresponding plural form. Both
  regularity and number dominance have been shown to affect plural noun
  production in both unimpaired and aphasic speakers, but the underlying
  functional origin of these effects is still a matter of debate. The results
  point to differences in the lexical representation and processing of regular
  and irregular German plural nouns. Thus, the data are in line with the dual
  mechanism account."
