  This study follows the footsteps of Jonathan Grainger and colleagues by
  investigating
  compound  processing  in  English  monolinguals  and  Chinese-English  bilinguals  using  the
  masked primed lexical decision paradigm. First language (L1) and second
  language
  (L2)  speakers  responded  to  a  semantically  transparent  compound  (e.g.,  *snowball*-*SNOW*),
  a semantically opaque compound (*honeymoon*-*HONEY*), and an orthographic
  control condition (e.g., *sandwich*-*SAND*). Results revealed significantly
  larger L1 priming effects in transparent and opaque compared to the control
  condition (Experiment 1A),
  whereas  no  significant  differences  across  conditions  were  observed  in  L2  speakers  (Experiment
  1B). We argue that L1 populations are sensitive to morphological structure
  during  the  early  stages  of  compound  processing,  whereas  L2  speakers,  in  particular  those
  with lower levels of language proficiency, employ a form-based type of
  analysis.
  Findings  are  interpreted  within  the  framework  of  recent  monolingual  and  bilingual  models
  of complex word recognition.HASIBE KAHRAMAN ELISABETH BEYERSMANN *Author
