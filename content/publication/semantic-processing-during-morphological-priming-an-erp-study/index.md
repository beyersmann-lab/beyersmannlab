abstract: Previous research has yielded conflicting results regarding the onset
  of semantic processing during morphological priming. The present study was
  designed to further explore the time-course of morphological processing using
  event-related potentials (ERPs). We conducted a primed lexical decision study
  comparing a morphological (LAVAGE - laver [washing - wash]), a semantic (LINGE
  - laver [laundry - wash]), an orthographic (LAVANDE - laver [lavender -
  wash]), and an unrelated control condition (HOSPICE - laver [nursing home -
  wash]), using the same targets across the four priming conditions. The
  behavioral data showed significant effects of morphological and semantic
  priming, with the magnitude of morphological priming being significantly
  larger than the magnitude of semantic priming. The ERP data revealed
  significant morphological but no semantic priming at 100-250 ms. Furthermore,
  a reduction of the N400 amplitude in the morphological condition compared to
  the semantic and orthographic condition demonstrates that the morphological
  priming effect was not entirely due to the semantic or orthographic overlap
  between the prime and the target. The present data reflect an early process of
  semantically blind morphological decomposition, and a later process of
  morpho-semantic decomposition, which we discuss in the context of recent
  morphological processing theories.
