abstract: "Recent research investigating embedded stem priming effects with the
  masked priming paradigm and pseudoword primes (e.g., *quickify*–*quick*) has
  shown that priming effects can be obtained even when the embedded target word
  is followed by a non-morphological ending (e.g., *quickald*–*quick*). Here we
  examine the specific nature of such priming effects by testing whether they
  are modulated by morphological family size. We reasoned that if the effects
  are driven by pre-lexical orthographic processing then they should not be
  influenced by the family size of the embedded target word. On the contrary, we
  found that embedded words having several morphologically related family
  members (e.g., *serpentoche*–*SERPENT* [English:
  *snakerel*–*SNAKE*]—*serpents*, *serpentin*, *serpentine*, *serpenter*,
  *serpentant*) generated greater priming than embedded words having only the
  plural form in the morphological family (e.g., *dauphingri*–*DAUPHIN*
  [English: *dolphinald*–*DOLPHIN*]). We therefore conclude that embedded stem
  priming is at least partly driven by processing at the level of lexical and
  morpho-semantic representations."
