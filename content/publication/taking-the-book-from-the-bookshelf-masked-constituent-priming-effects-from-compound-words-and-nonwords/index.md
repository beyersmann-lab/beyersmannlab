abstract: Recent evidence from visual word recognition points to the important
  role of embedded words, suggesting that embedded words are activated
  independently of whether they are accompanied by an affix or a non-affix. The
  goal of the present research was to more closely examine the mechanisms
  involved in embedded word activation, particularly with respect to the
  “edge-alignedness” of the embedded word. We conducted two experiments that
  used masked priming in combination with lexical decision. In Experiment 1,
  monomorphemic target words were either preceded by a compound word prime
  (e.g., *textbook-BOOK/textbook-TEXT*), a compound-nonword prime (e.g.,
  *pilebook-BOOK/textpile-TEXT*), a non-compound nonword prime (e.g.,
  *pimebook-BOOK/textpime-TEXT*) or an unrelated prime (e.g.,
  *textjail-BOOK/jailbook-TEXT*). The results revealed significant priming
  effects, not only in the compound word and compound-nonword conditions, but
  also in the non-compound nonword condition, suggesting that embedded words
  (e.g., *book*) were activated independently of whether they occurred in
  combination with a real morpheme (e.g., *pilebook*) or a non-morphemic
  constituent (e.g., *pimebook*). Priming in the compound word condition was
  greater than in the two nonword conditions, indicating that participants
  benefited from the whole-word representation of real compound words.
  Constituent priming occurred independently of whether the target word was the
  first or the second embedded constituent of the prime (e.g., *textbook-BOOK*
  vs. *textbook-TEXT*). In Experiment 2, significant priming effects were found
  for edge-aligned embedded constituents (e.g., *pimebook-BOOK*), but not for
  mid-embedded (e.g., *pibookme-BOOK*) or the outer-embedded constituents (e.g.,
  *bopimeok-BOOK*), suggesting that edge-alignedness is a key factor determining
  the activation of embedded words.
