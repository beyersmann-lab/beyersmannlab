abstract: "**Purpose:** Children learning to read in English must learn to read
  words with varying degrees of grapheme-phoneme correspondence regularity, but
  there is very little research comparing methods of instruction for words with
  less predictable or irregular spellings. Therefore, we compared three methods
  of instruction for beginning readers. **Method:** Eighty-five Kindergarten
  children were randomly assigned to either Look and Say (LSay), Look and Spell
  (LSpell), mispronunciation correction (MPC), or wait-list control conditions.
  Children were taught 12 irregular words over three sessions. Amount of
  instructional time and number of exposures to the written and spoken forms of
  the words was controlled across the three experimental conditions. After
  training, children were assessed on reading aloud and orthographic choice
  measures. **Results:** Children showed evidence of superior learning of
  trained words in the LSpell and MPC conditions, compared to LSay and control
  conditions. Differences between the LSpell and MPC conditions were not
  significant. There was no evidence of generalization to untrained items.
  **Conclusions:** Findings indicate that active processing of a wordâ€™s
  orthography is crucial for learning irregular words. These results have
  implications for initial reading instruction. Further research is required to
  determine whether differences between LSpell and MPC conditions emerge after
  longer periods of training."
