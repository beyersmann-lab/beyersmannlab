abstract: "The use of emojis in digital communication has become increasingly
  popular, but how emojis are processed and integrated in reading processes
  remains underexplored. This study used eye-tracking to monitor university
  studentsâ€™ (*n* = 47) eye movements while reading single-line text messages
  with a face emoji embedded medially. Messages contained a semantically
  congruent emoji (e.g., *Thatâ€™s good news ðŸ˜Š tell me more*), a semantically
  incongruent emoji (e.g., *Thatâ€™s good news â˜¹ tell me more*), or a dash (e.g.,
  *Thatâ€™s good news â€“ tell me more*). Results revealed that emoji congruency did
  not influence early fixation measures (first fixation duration and gaze
  duration), nor the probability of regressions. However, there was a
  significant congruency effect in total reading time and trial dwell time,
  showing that incongruence incurred a processing cost. The present results
  extend previously reported semantic congruency effects in sentence reading to
  the processing of emojis. This result suggests that the semantic content
  conveyed by face emojis is integrated with sentence context late in
  processing. We further found that the use of congruent emojis improved the
  relationship between sender and receiver: Ratings collected separately
  suggested that message senders were liked better if they included congruent
  than incongruent emojis. Overall, emojis attracted attention: Participants
  were twice as likely to fixate on emojis than on dashes, and to fixate on
  emojis for longer."
