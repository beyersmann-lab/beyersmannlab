abstract: Previous studies have confirmed stem morphemes (e.g., book) are
  identified in any position (e.g., in both bookmark and textbook) but prefixes
  and suffixes (e.g., re- in replay and -er in player) cannot be recognized when
  moved from their typical word-initial or word-final locations. However,
  English words with multiple affixes (e.g., unresolved, mindfulness) suggest
  there must be further nuance to the positional constraints imposed on affixes
  in the reading system to facilitate cases where affixes occur in atypical
  locations but still convey meaning. We used two lexical decision experiments
  (N = 90 native English-speaking participants each) to investigate the
  positional encoding of mid-embedded suffixes. In Experiment 1, transposed
  tri-morphemic nonwords ending in a chain of two suffixes (e.g., spitenessful
  [derived from spitefulness]), and transposed nonwords with string-initial
  suffixes (e.g., fulyouthness [derived from youthfulness]) were compared
  against orthographic controls (e.g., spitementdom/domyouthment). In Experiment
  2, transposed tri-morphemic nonwords ending in a stem (e.g., bestersell
  [derived from bestseller]) and transposed nonwords with string-initial
  suffixes (e.g., erwalksleep [derived from sleepwalker]) were compared against
  orthographic controls (e.g., bestalsell/enwalksleep). Across both experiments,
  the results revealed a significantly larger morpheme transposition effect
  relative to controls for the mid-embedded compared with the string-initial
  suffix conditions. Items like bestersell activated the corresponding lexical
  representation of "bestseller" and made it more difficult to reject the target
  nonword, revealing that suffixes are not as strictly positionally encoded as
  previously assumed. These findings challenge existing predictions of
  positional requirements for affixes and provide evidence calling for more
  nuanced theoretical models of morphological processing.
