abstract: "Empirical evidence from masked priming research shows that skilled
  readers can rapidly identify morphological structure in written language.
  However, comparatively little is known about how and when this skill is
  acquired in children. The current work investigated the developmental
  trajectory of morphological processing in a 2-year longitudinal study
  involving two large cohorts of German and French primary school children. The
  masked priming paradigm was used within an experimental design that allowed us
  to dissociate effects of (a) nonmorphological embedded word activation, (b)
  morpho-orthographic decomposition, and (c) morpho-semantics. Four priming
  conditions were used: affixed word (*farmer-FARM*), affixed nonword
  (*farmity-FARM*), nonaffixed nonword (*farmald-FARM*), and unrelated control
  (*workald-FARM*). The results revealed robust embedded word priming effects
  across both languages. However, morpho-orthographic and morpho-semantic
  effects were evident only in the French sample. These findings are discussed
  in the context of a theoretical framework that specifies the distinct roles
  played by embedded words and affixes, their distinct developmental
  trajectories, and how the intrinsic linguistic properties of a given language
  may affect morphological processing."
