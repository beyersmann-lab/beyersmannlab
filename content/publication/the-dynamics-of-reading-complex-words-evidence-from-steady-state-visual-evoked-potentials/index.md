abstract: "The present study used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs)
  to examine the spatio-temporal dynamics of reading morphologically complex
  words and test the neurophysiological activation pattern elicited by stems and
  suffixes. Three different types of target words were presented to proficient
  readers in a delayed naming task: truly suffixed words (e.g., *farmer*),
  pseudo-suffixed words (e.g., *corner*), and non-suffixed words (e.g.,
  *cashew*). Embedded stems and affixes were flickered at two different
  frequencies (18.75 Hz and 12.50 Hz, respectively). The stem data revealed an
  earlier SSVEP peak in the truly suffixed and pseudo-suffixed conditions
  compared to the non-suffixed condition, thus providing evidence for the
  form-based activation of embedded stems during reading. The suffix data also
  showed a dissociation in the SSVEP response between suffixes and non-suffixes
  with an additional activation boost for truly suffixed words. The observed
  differences are discussed in the context of current models of complex word
  recognition."
