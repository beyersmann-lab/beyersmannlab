abstract: The present study explored the role of constituent frequency and
  distractor type in complex word learning. Skilled readers were trained to
  associate novel letter strings with one out of two pictures, with one picture
  serving as the target, and the other as a distractor. A facilitatory effect of
  first-constituent frequency was found only in trials where distractors
  promoted first-constituent learning, and a facilitatory effect of
  second-constituent frequency only in trials where distractors promoted
  second-constituent learning, but not vice versa. Learning occurred in the
  absence of any pre-existing knowledge about the constituent morphemes and any
  explicit reference to the constituents during learning. The results point to
  the important role of constituent frequency and distractor type in novel word
  learning and provide insights into the mechanisms involved in the implicit
  acquisition of morphological knowledge in adult learners, that we suspect to
  be a key aspect of language learning in general.
