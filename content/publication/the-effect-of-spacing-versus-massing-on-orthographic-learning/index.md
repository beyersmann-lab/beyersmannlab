abstract: "Distributing study opportunities over time typically improves the
  retention of verbal material compared to consecutive study trials, yet little
  is known about the influence of temporal spacing on the learning of
  orthographic form specifically. This experiment sought to obtain and compare
  estimates of the magnitude of the spacing effect on written word form learning
  across three different outcome measures, administered between-participants.
  Skilled adult readers (*N*=120) read aloud 16 sentences containing an embedded
  pseudoword a total of four times. Half of the items were temporally
  distributed (appearing once in each of four blocks), while half were massed
  (read on four consecutive trials within a block). After a short delay,
  learning was assessed using tests of recognition (orthographic choice) or
  recall (spelling to dictation or letter cue spelling). There was a significant
  effect of spacing across all outcome measures (all *p* < .001). When the
  magnitude of the spacing effect was compared across these three measures,
  letter cue spelling showed a significantly larger spacing effect than spelling
  to dictation (*p* = .039)while orthographic choice did not significantly
  differ from either (both *p* > .05). These findings indicate that temporal
  spacing influences the learning of orthographic form, regardless of the
  outcome measure used.  "
