abstract: Do readers benefit from their knowledge of the phonological form and
  meaning of stems when seeing them embedded in morphologically complex words
  for the first time in print? This question was addressed using a word learning
  paradigm. Participants were trained on novel spoken word stems and their
  meanings ("tump"). Following training, participants then saw the novel stems
  for the first time in print, either in combination with a real affix
  (*tumpist*, *tumpor*) or with a non-affix (*tumpel*, *tumpain*). Untrained
  items were also included to test whether the affix effect was modulated by the
  prior training of the spoken word stems. First, the complex words were
  embedded in meaningful sentences which participants read as their eye
  movements were recorded (first orthographic exposure). Second, participants
  were asked to read aloud and spell each individual complex novel word (second
  orthographic exposure). Participants spent less time fixating on words that
  included trained stems compared with untrained stems. However, the training
  effect did not change depending on whether stems were accompanied by a real
  affix or a non-affix. In the reading aloud and spelling tasks, there was no
  effect of training, suggesting that the effect of oral vocabulary training did
  not extend beyond the initial print exposure. The results indicate that
  familiarity with spoken stems influences how complex words containing those
  stems are processed when being read for the first time. Our findings highlight
  the flexibility and adaptability of the morphological processing system to
  novel complex words during the first print exposure.
