abstract: In this pre-registered meta-analysis, we investigated the
  effectiveness of morphology instruction on literacy outcomes for primary
  school children in English-speaking countries. We were interested in overall
  reading and spelling outcomes, but we also looked separately at results for
  trained and untrained words in order to determine whether there was evidence
  of transfer to untrained words. Further, we were interested in whether results
  transferred beyond the word level to reading comprehension outcomes. Our
  screening process revealed 28 eligible studies, which contributed 177 effect
  sizes to the analyses. Robust variance estimation methods were used to account
  for dependence between effect sizes. Overall, effect sizes on reading and
  spelling outcomes were small to moderate. Effect sizes were larger for trained
  words than untrained words. There was evidence of transfer to untrained words
  for spelling outcomes, but not for reading outcomes. There was also no clear
  evidence of effects on reading comprehension outcomes. In general, the
  evidence was characterised by large amounts of heterogeneity and imprecision,
  which was reflective of the wide variety within and between studies in terms
  of intervention content, outcome measures, intervention dosage and type of
  control group. We discuss the limitations of the current literature and make
  recommendations for future research and practice in the field of morphology
  instruction.
