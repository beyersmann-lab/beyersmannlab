abstract: Despite substantial evidence that spacing study opportunities over
  time improves the retention of learned verbal material compared with study
  trials that occur consecutively, the influence of temporal spacing on
  children’s learning of written words has not been investigated. This
  experiment examined whether temporal spacing influenced Grade 3 and 4
  children’s (*N* = 37; mean age = 8 years 7 months) learning of novel written
  words during independent reading compared with massing. Children read 16
  sentences containing a novel word under either a spaced (sentences appeared
  once in each of four blocks) or massed conditions (four consecutive trials).
  After a delay, orthographic learning was assessed using recognition
  (orthographic choice) and recall (spelling to dictation) measures. Words
  experienced in the spaced condition were better recognized than those in the
  massed condition, but there was no effect on recall. These findings suggest
  that temporal spacing influences the acquisition of new written word forms,
  extending the potential utility of the spacing principle to reading
  acquisition.
