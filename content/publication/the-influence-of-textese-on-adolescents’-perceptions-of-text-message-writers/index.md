abstract: Text messages are characterised by a casual language style, ‘textese’
  (e.g., *c u on thurs*). This study investigated adolescents’ perceptions of
  the use of different levels of textese in digital messages which varied in
  their intended recipient (friend, teacher). Grade 8 students in Australia (*N*
  = 90, aged 13–14 years) each read six text messages purportedly written by a
  fellow student, and rated the extent to which they agreed (on a 7-point Likert
  scale) that the message writer was intelligent, paid attention to detail, used
  an appropriate writing style, and was friendly. Overall, participants rated
  message senders most favourably on all measures when they used no textese, and
  least favourably when they used high levels of textese. This pattern was even
  stronger when messages were addressed to teachers rather than same-aged
  friends. The findings suggest that adolescents are sensitive to both writing
  style and recipient when considering digital messages.
