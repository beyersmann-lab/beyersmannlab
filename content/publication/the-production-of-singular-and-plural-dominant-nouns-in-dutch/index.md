abstract: The role of number dominance (singular vs. plural) in word production
  has revealed contrasting results in Dutch and English. Here, we compared the
  production of Dutch regular plural forms that are more frequent than their
  stems (plural-dominant plurals) to plurals that are less frequent than their
  stems (singular-dominant plurals) in a spoken picture-naming paradigm.
  Moreover, the role of inflectional entropy during spoken word production was
  assessed. The results revealed that singular-dominant singulars were produced
  significantly faster and more accurately than their corresponding plurals,
  independently of inflectional entropy. However, the production of
  plural-dominant plurals and singulars was modulated by inflectional entropy,
  and a plural disadvantage only found if the inflectional variants were not
  uniformly distributed. Critically, uniformly distributed variants showed a
  plural advantage in this condition. Our findings suggest that
  singular-dominant and plural-dominant plurals are processed differently, which
  we discuss in the context of morphological processing theories in spoken
  language production.
