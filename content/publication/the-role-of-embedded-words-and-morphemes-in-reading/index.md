abstract: This chapter describes a model that accounts for various phenomena
  related to morphological processing in skilled reading and reading
  acquisition. The model implements a non-morphological mechanism of embedded
  word activation and a morphological affix activation mechanism associated with
  the principle of morpho-orthographic full decomposition. It builds on two
  streams of research that have emerged from the field of visual word
  recognition. The first stream centres on the examination of morphologically
  complex words like farmer and presents evidence for a mechanism by which
  skilled readers decompose complex words into morphemic subunits (*farm* +
  *er*). The second stream focuses on the investigation of complex nonwords like
  farmity and speaks in favour of a non-morphological mechanism by which
  embedded words (*farm*) are activated by mapping letters onto whole-word
  representations. Our model combines affix and embedded word activation in the
  form of two parallel mechanisms for associating orthography with meaning
  during reading. The combination of these two mechanisms is further supported
  by findings from younger readers, showing that embedded word activation and
  morpho-orthographic processing are acquired at different developmental stages.
  Embedded word activation develops early, whereas the ability to decompose
  words into morphemes is a comparatively late acquired milestone.
