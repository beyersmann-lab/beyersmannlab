abstract: This study used a novel word learning paradigm to investigate the role
  of morphology in the acquisition of complex words, when participants have no
  prior lexical knowledge of the embedded morphemic constituents. The influence
  of morphological family size on novel word learning was examined by comparing
  novel stems (*torb*) combined with large morphological families (e.g.,
  *torbnel*, *torbilm*, *torbla*, *torbiph*) as opposed to small morphological
  families (e.g., *torbilm*, *torbla*). In two online experiments, participants
  learned complex novel words by associating words with pictures. Following
  training, participants performed a recognition and a spelling task where they
  were exposed to novel words that either did or did not contain a trained
  morpheme. As predicted, items consisting of a trained and an untrained
  constituent were harder to reject but easier to spell than those that did not
  contain any trained constituents. Moreover, novel words including trained
  constituents with large morphological families were harder to reject than
  those including constituents with small morphological families. The findings
  suggest that participants acquired novel morphemic constituents without prior
  knowledge of the constituents and point to the important facilitatory role of
  morphological family size in novel word learning.
