abstract: The present study asked whether oral vocabulary training can
  facilitate reading in a second language (L2). Fifty L2 speakers of English
  received oral training over three days on complex novel words, with
  predictable and unpredictable spellings, composed of novel stems and existing
  suffixes (i.e., *vishing*, *vishes*, *vished*). After training, participants
  read the novel word stems for the first time (i.e., trained and untrained),
  embedded in sentences, and their eye movements were monitored. The
  eye-tracking data revealed shorter looking times for trained than untrained
  stems, and for stems with predictable than unpredictable spellings. In
  contrast to monolingual speakers of English, the interaction between training
  and spelling predictability was not significant, suggesting that L2 speakers
  did not generate orthographic skeletons that were robust enough to affect
  their eye-movement behaviour when seeing the trained novel words for the first
  time in print.
