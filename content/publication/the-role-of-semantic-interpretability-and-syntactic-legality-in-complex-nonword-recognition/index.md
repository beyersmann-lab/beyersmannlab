abstract: "This study explored the role of semantic interpretability and
  syntactic legality on complex nonword recognition. A rating experiment tested
  the correlation between these two linguistic factors by asking participants to
  rate the interpretability of legal and illegal nonwords made up of stem-suffix
  combinations. Results showed that these two factors are highly correlated. In
  two further lexical decision experiments (unprimed lexical decision in
  Experiment 2 and masked primed lexical decision in Experiment 3), we carefully
  dissociated interpretability and legality by comparing four types of nonwords:
  high-interpretability syntactically legal, high-interpretability syntactically
  illegal, low-interpretability syntactically legal, and low-interpretability
  syntactically illegal nonwords. To test whether or not the activation of
  embedded stems was modulated by their morpho-semantic and morpho-syntactic
  context, all complex nonwords were compared against a matched non-stem
  control.  A significant effect of stem status was found in Experiments 2 and
  3, providing evidence for the important role of embedded stems in complex
  nonword recognition. Moreover, a significant effect of interpretability was
  found only in the unprimed lexical decision (Experiment 2), but not in masked
  priming (Experiment 3), suggesting that semantics does not influence complex
  word recognition until participants have enough time to thoroughly process the
  nonword. No effect of syntactic legality was found in either experiment. These
  results highlight the independent roles of semantic interpretability and
  syntactic legality in visual nonword recognition, supporting an initial
  semantically blind stage in morphological parsing."
