abstract: German skilled readers have been found to engage in morphological and
  syllable-based processing in visual word recognition. However, the relative
  reliance on syllables and morphemes in reading multi-syllabic complex words is
  still unresolved. The present study aimed to unveil which of these sub-lexical
  units are the preferred units of reading by employing eye-tracking technology.
  Participants silently read sentences while their eye movements were recorded.
  Words were visually marked by the use of color alternation (Experiment 1) or
  hyphenation (Experiment 2), either at syllable boundary (e.g., *Kir-schen*),
  at morpheme boundary (e.g., *Kirsch-en*) or within the units themselves (e.g.,
  *Ki-rschen*). A control condition without disruptions was used as a baseline
  (e.g., *Kirschen*). The results of Experiment 1 showed that eye-movements were
  not modulated by color alternations. The results of Experiment 2 indicated
  that hyphens disrupting syllables had a larger inhibitory effect on reading
  times than hyphens disrupting morphemes, suggesting that eye-movements in
  German skilled readers are more influenced by syllabic than morphological
  structure.
