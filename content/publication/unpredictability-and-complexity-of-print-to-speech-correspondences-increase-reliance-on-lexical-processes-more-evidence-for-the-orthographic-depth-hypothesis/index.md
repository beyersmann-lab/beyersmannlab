abstract: "The Orthographic Depth Hypothesis [Katz, L., & Frost, R. (1992). The
  reading process is different for different orthographies: The orthographic
  depth hypothesis. In R. Frost & L. Katz (Eds.), *Orthography, phonology,
  morphology, and meaning* (pp. 67–84). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science] proposes
  cross-linguistic differences in the involvement of lexical processing during
  reading. In orthographies with complex, inconsistent, and/or incomplete
  sublexical correspondences, decoding is more difficult and therefore slower.
  This gives more time to the lexical route to retrieve information, and leads
  to a greater ratio of lexical processing. We test whether this mechanism
  applies both for words with inconsistent (in English) and for words with
  complex (in French) correspondences. As complex correspondences are sufficient
  to derive a correct pronunciation, an increase in lexical processing may not
  occur. In a reading-aloud task, we used the frequency effect to measure
  lexical processing. The data showed stronger involvement of lexical processing
  for inconsistent compared to consistent words, and for complex compared to
  simple words. The results confirm that Katz and Frost’s proposed mechanism
  applies to different sources of orthographic depth."
