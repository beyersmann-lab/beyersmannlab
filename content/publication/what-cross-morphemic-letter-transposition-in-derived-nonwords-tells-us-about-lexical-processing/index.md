abstract: According to an obligatory decomposition account of polymorphemic word
  recognition, a nonword that is composed of a real word plus derivational affix
  (e.g., teachen) should prime its stem (TEACH) to the same extent that a truly
  suffixed word does (e.g., teacher). The stem will be activated in both cases
  after the suffix is removed prior to the lexical status of the letter-string
  being of relevance. Importantly, disruption to the stem and suffix through
  letter transposition should have the same impact on the nonwords and words,
  with teacehn and teacehr equally priming TEACH. However, an experiment by
  Diependaele, Morris, Serota, Bertrand, and Grainger (2013) found that the
  equivalent priming for nonwords and words only occurred when they were intact.
  When letters were transposed, only the truly derived words showed priming.
  Since such a result cannot be handled by an obligatory decomposition account,
  it is important to replicate it. Therefore, the present study repeated the
  conditions of Diependaele et al. (2013), along with a nonword condition where
  the stem was followed by a non-suffix (e.g., teachin or teacihn). It was found
  that priming was maintained across all conditions regardless of letter
  transposition, hence maintaining obligatory decomposition as a viable account.
  However, the findings with the non-suffixed nonwords led to the conclusion
  that morphological structure does not control decomposition, but rather, has
  its impact after form-based components of the letter-string have been
  activated.
