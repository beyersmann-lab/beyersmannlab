title: "Walking Lab"  # Add a page title.
summary: "The Walking Lab meets every fortnight and is based on the idea that walking encourages thinking. Many philosophers, such as Socrates and Aristotle, walked with their students. In fact, Aristotle was known to walk in his lectures, as he believed that walking facilitates thinking. Instead of meeting in a conventional conference room, the Walking Lab meeting is entirely media-free and takes place in a new campus location every time, including both indoor and outdoor venues. The lab walks together from our department building to a specific location on campus, where the meeting is held either standing or sitting. Not only does the meeting allow lab members to discover the unexpected variety of campus features such as lawns, amphitheatres, botanical gardens, and roof top terrasses, but it also provides an opportunity to brainstorm, network, and have a desk-free hour in the day."  # Add a page description.
