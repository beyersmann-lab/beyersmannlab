title: Walking Lab
subtitle: The Walking Lab meets every fortnight and is based on the idea that walking facilitates talking, thinking, brainstorming, and networking. Instead of meeting in a conventional conference room, the Walking Lab meeting is entirely media-free and desk-free and takes place in a new campus location each time, including amphitheatres, botanical gardens, and rooftop terraces.
