title: Learning Circle - 23 May 2024
summary: The Learning Circle honours the Dharug people, the traditional owners of Macquarie University’s lands. It serves as a culturally safe environment for gathering and sharing knowledge, a practice ingrained in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures for tens of thousands of years. In the background of the image, you can see the Central Courtyard building to the middle-right and Central Courtyard Accommodation to the right of that. You can also see some of The Chancellery building to the left.
