title: Wally's Walk - 5 December 2023
summary: Wally's Walk is the main walkway through Macquarie University and stretches almost one kilometre. This iconic walkway was named after Macquarie University's early Architect Planner, the late Dr Walter Victor "Wally" Abraham, who designed the campus's layout and oversaw its development from 1964 to 1983. Pictured is the outside of one of the buildings along Wally's Walk, '18 Wally's Walk', which is home to Service Connect (the first point of contact for enquiries), IT Services, and study spaces.
